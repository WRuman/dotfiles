# Dotfiles
A place to store config files that I want to re-use. I currently have some special .vimrc files,
including one that has support for Vundle-based plugins.

Also included is an initial configuration for Spacemacs, a configuration layer over Emacs that 
I've been trying out at work. I haven't included the full Spacemacs install, only the config
file I've customized.
